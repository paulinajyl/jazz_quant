# Quantitative Perspectives on Jazz Improvisation
Jazz is often misunderstood as elevator music. A bunch of of random notes played together that no one really understands â€” which in a sense is kind of true. But I want to try to understand what makes the randomness random, and explore how we can quantify the evolution of music. My investigative project explores how quantitative methods can show the inner workings of jazz improvisations to be more than just random note playing.

# Quantitative Perspectives on Jazz Improvisation

Jazz is often misunderstood as random, but my project aims to explore the structure behind this "randomness" by applying quantitative methods to jazz improvisation.

## To Run the Pipeline

Follow these steps to run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository with Git LFS
This project uses Git Large File Storage (LFS) to handle large files like MIDI and audio. To clone the repo with LFS:

1. **Install Git LFS** if you haven't already: [Git LFS installation](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone URl-HERE
   ```
3. Pull the large files:
   ```bash
   git lfs pull
   ```

### 2. Set Up the Working Directory
Ensure the `data/` directory is in the working directory of the cloned repo. This is where all necessary files are stored.

### 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open `jazz_quant_clean.ipynb` and run all cells. The analysis should complete without any issues if the data is correctly placed.

Now you're all set to explore the quantitative analysis of jazz improvisation!
